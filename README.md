# eCommerce Site

## Description

This is an application that is designed to be the back end for an ecommerce website to update and maintain their inventory.  With Insomnia, users can post, put, delete and get their products, tags and categories to keep track of and update their online store.  This is a unique application that shows the power of the command line along with exporting and importing routes.  We utilize mysql2 and sequelize to accomplish this.
